Welcome to CodeIgniter4
#######################

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and
secure.

It is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for
people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to
develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code
from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed
tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access
these libraries.

CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount
of code needed for a given task.

Where possible, CodeIgniter has been kept as flexible as possible,
allowing you to work in the way you want, not being forced into working
any certain way. The framework can have core parts easily extended
or completely replaced to make the system work the way you need it to.

In short, CodeIgniter is the malleable framework that tries to provide the tools
you need while staying out of the way.
