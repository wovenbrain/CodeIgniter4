Time::createFromTimestamp()
===========================

A bug that caused :ref:`Time::createFromTimestamp() <time-createfromtimestamp>`
to return a Time instance with a timezone of UTC has been fixed.

Starting with this version, when you do not specify a timezone, a Time instance
with the app's timezone is returned by default.

**********
Bugs Fixed
**********

- **Session:** Fixed a bug in Redis session handler that caused locking to fail
  and the session data to be cleared.
- **DB Forge:** Fixed a bug in SQLite3 Forge that caused ``Forge::modifyColumn()``
  to incorrectly modify table definitions.
- **CSP:** Fixed a bug that CSP blocked some elements in the Debug Toolbar.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
